				<p>First of all, you'll need a forge and an anvil. For the forge, there are bacically two options, you could make the forge yourself, or you could just buy one. Forges come in many diffrent shapes, sizes, and fuel systems, but for startig out it would be in your best intrest to buy a gas forge as they are much less work that one that runs on coal or coke.
					 As far as the anvil goes, you genrally want an anvil that has a relativley flat working surface, meaning that there aren't a bunch of divets from where pervious owners 
					might have bee working, it's fine if there are divets on the shelf between the horn and the working surface. When buying an anvil used, you should tap o the working surface 
					and listen for dead sounding spots, indicating the steel surface is delaminating from the cast iron. Also keep in mind that it's a good idea to check for welds because this could mean that the anvil has been resurface at home and 
					could possibly delaminate depending on what type of metal they were using for the welding</p>

				<h2>You will additionally need some safety gear and tools</h2>

			<div class='topic2Para'>
				<p>You'll need some tools to go with that avil and forge. Lets start with some basic safety gear. You should always 
					have a thick leather apron to protect your clothes from sparks and other fire hazardes, you should have a good range of hammers of diffrent weights 
					for diffrent jobs, you should always have saftey glasses on, always wear closed toe shoes or boots, get a thick pair of welding or just heavy leather gloves, get a good size, heavy vice, and get some tongs.
